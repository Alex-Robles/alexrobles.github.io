							<h3>Defining the Challenge</h3>

						</header>
						<p>Inspiration is the first element of the Design Thinking Process, which involves the first phase of the process called "Understand" in defining the problem. Because of my experience and involvement in cryptocurrencies I decided to develop a solution to a growing issue within the cryptocurrency community. That issue is the lack of accurate and legitimate information, expertise, and assistance that is not readily available in this young and nascent market.</p>

							<h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
							<a href="images/fulls/SWOT Analysis.PNG" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/thumbs/SWOT Analysis.PNG" alt="" /></a>
						</header>
						<p>Analyzing the competitive landscape was necessary in understanding current solutions to our afformentioned problem. A scan of the competitive landscape was done using SWOT analysis on several potential competitors, which solicited vital information necessary in understand our users on from a deep perspective.</p>

						<p>Exlporing the data collected from user interviews was analyzed into an affinity map, which provided insight into the personal perspectives of current users. User Research Analysis provided the necessary information needed to create User Personas.</p>

							<h3>User Personas</h3>

						</header>
						<p>My research thus far lead to the creation of User Personas, which provided invaluable insight into the personal feelings and thoughts when making investment decisions or participating in investment activities. User Personas greatly assisted me in preparing for the next phase of the Design Thinking Process, the Ideation phase.</p>

						<p>After laying out several frameworks, the underlying surface started to appear in the form of design frames. Ideation started out with paper and sketch designs to low-fi frames using software such as Balsamiq. From low-fi the designs were transferred to Mid-fidelity using programs such as Figma to create a mobile-like app that feels real. The last mockup in color is a part of the final product, which is a solution that helps resolve several user issues that many people have with researching information.</p>
