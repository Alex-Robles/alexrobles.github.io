							<h2>About Me<br /></h2>
						</header>
						<p>I am a Business Analyst-turned-UX-Desinger with fresh skills in user research, user testing, user flows, designing wireframes, and prototyping. With my newly acquired skillset, posessing a background in business combined with User Experience Design maks me well rounded and able to work in various roles and dynamic settings. I have a passion for Fin-Tech, cryptocurrencies, and how we interact with technology.</p>
						<p>I served in the U.S. Army for seven years in various domestic and overseas assignments. I have held various leadership positions and managed people at different echelons. My work experience includes but is not limited to: Program Analysis and Integration Management, Project Management, Human Resources Management, and Business Analysis. I speak French, Spanish, English and German.</p>
						<p>With my unique insight of complex projects and a diverse background in business, I feel that I’m ready to make a difference in an innovative team that places their client’s user experience at the forefront of their company mission. Furthermore, I am looking to make a positive impact on people’s lives by designing and offering digital projects easy and more intuitive to use. To end my introduction, I go by this motto: “Attitude determines altitude.”</p>
